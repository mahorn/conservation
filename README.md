# [Conservation Areas in South America](https://geo.gob.bo/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/46bb6940-2f29-40bd-a330-64edd523a3e9)

From the Peruvian Andes to Mexico's white-sand beaches, Latin America and the Caribeean plays home to 34% of the world's plant species and 27% of mammals, making it one of the world's biodiversity 'superpowers' but, only a fifth of its land is set aside for conservation (worldbank.org).

I am mapping the Conservation Areas in South America because I want to help create awareness about the rich biodiversity we can find there. 

## Data

The data was obtained from the catalogue GeoBolivia: [Mapa Área de Conservación Suramerica COSIPLAN, 2015](https://geo.gob.bo/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/46bb6940-2f29-40bd-a330-64edd523a3e9)
