## Conservation Areas in Sudamerica

From the Peruvian Andes to Mexico's white-sand beaches, Latin America and the Caribeean plays home to 34% of the world's plant species and 27% of mammals, making it one of the world's biodiversity 'superpowers' but, only a fifth of its land is set aside for conservation (worldbank.org).

I am mapping the Conservation Areas in Sudamerica because I want to help create awareness about the rich biodiversity we can find there.
