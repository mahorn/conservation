# [Conservation Areas in Latin America](https://geo.gob.bo/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/46bb6940-2f29-40bd-a330-64edd523a3e9)


The protected areas of Latin America and the world are the most valuable places for *in situ* conservation (Elbers, J, p.13). Accounting 34% of the world's plant species and 27% of mammals it is one of the world's biodiversity 'superpowers' (worldbank.org). The preservation of these treasure lands are very important due to the evident menace of man and its economic activities in the XXI century (Elbers, J, p.13). 

With the creation of these maps I want to emphasize the value and importance of the protected areas for Latin America and the world.

We included the 10 latin america countries and the two Independent Guayane Sates: Guyana and Surinam.
